When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Access content from different sites or share with others easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To be aware of all the changes being made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork to give credit and copy only to github, Clone to work on my pc and Branch to add another feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Apply changes where needed faster.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
E-mail changes along with details. Easier to understand the changes faster, harder to implement them.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Branch leaves the master branch unaffected making easier to distiguish the change but requires more work.
